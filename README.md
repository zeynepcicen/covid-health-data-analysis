# COVID-19 Health Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global COVID-19 health data.
The main objective is to examine trends in total COVID-19 cases and compare death rates
across selected countries using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset
- Link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases
- Key variables:
  - Location (country)
  - Date
  - Total cases
  - Total deaths
- Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to file size limitations.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology / Workflow
1. Loaded the COVID-19 dataset using pandas.
2. Performed basic data cleaning and handled missing values.
3. Filtered the dataset for selected countries.
4. Converted date variables to datetime format for time-series analysis.
5. Calculated COVID-19 death rates using total deaths and total cases.
6. Created visualizations to analyze trends and compare countries.

## Key Visualizations
- Time series plot of total COVID-19 cases over time.
- Bar chart comparing COVID-19 death rates across countries.

## Results and Insights
- Total COVID-19 cases increased over time in all analyzed countries.
- COVID-19 death rates differ between countries.
- These differences may be influenced by healthcare capacity, testing strategies,
  population demographics, and vaccination coverage.

## Limitations
- Death rates are calculated using reported cases and deaths and may be affected
  by differences in data reporting practices.
- This analysis is descriptive and does not imply causal relationships.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates fundamental data analysis skills, including data cleaning,
exploratory analysis, visualization, and interpretation of real-world health data
using Python.

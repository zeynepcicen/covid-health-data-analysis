# COVID-19 Health Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis of global COVID-19 health data.
The aim is to examine trends in total cases and compare COVID-19 death rates across
selected countries using data visualization techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: Our World in Data (COVID-19 Dataset)
- Link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases
- Note: Due to file size limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Loaded and explored the COVID-19 dataset using pandas.
2. Cleaned and filtered the data for selected countries.
3. Converted date variables for time-series analysis.
4. Calculated COVID-19 death rates using total deaths and total cases.
5. Visualized trends and country-level comparisons using matplotlib.

## Key Findings
- COVID-19 case numbers increased over time across all analyzed countries.
- COVID-19 death rates vary between countries.
- These differences may be influenced by healthcare capacity, testing policies,
  population demographics, and vaccination coverage.

## Limitations
- Death rates are based on reported cases and deaths and may vary due to
  differences in data reporting across countries.
- The analysis is descriptive and does not imply causal relationships.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Python for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis,
and visualization of real-world health data.
